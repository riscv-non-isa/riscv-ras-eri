== Error Logging and Signaling

Components (e.g., a RISC-V hart, a memory controller, etc.) in a system that
support error detection may implement one or more banks of error records. Each
error record corresponds to a hardware unit of the component and reports errors
detected by that hardware unit. A hardware unit may implement multiple error
records. One or more error records may be valid at any instance of time due to
one or more hardware units in the component detecting an error or due to a
hardware unit having detected one or more errors.

Each error bank is memory-mapped and are located within a naturally aligned
4-KiB region (a page) of physical address space that exists for each error bank,
i.e., one page per bank. Each error bank may include up to 63 error records.
Each error record is a set of registers used to control that error record and to
report status, address, and other information relevant to the error recorded in
that error record.

The behavior for register accesses where the address is not aligned to
the size of the access, or if the access spans multiple registers, of if the
size of the access is not 4 bytes or 8 bytes, is `UNSPECIFIED`. The atomicity of
access to an 8 byte register is `UNSPECIFIED`. An aligned 4 byte access to a
RERI register must be single-copy atomic.

The RERI registers have little-endian byte order (even for systems where
all harts are big-endian-only).

[NOTE]
====
Big-endian-configured harts that make use of an RERI may implement the `REV8`
byte-reversal instruction defined by the Zbb extension. If `REV8` is not
implemented, then endianness conversion may be implemented using a sequence
of instructions.
====

An implementation-specific response occurs if the error bank and/or record is
unavailable (e.g., powered down) to memory-mapped accesses. For example, an
error bank and/or record  may respond with all zero data on reads and may
ignore writes. Other implementations may for example, signal a error response on
the attempted transaction.

A error bank that is otherwise available for memory-mapped accesses must respond
with all zero data on reads and must ignore writes to unimplemented registers in
the page.

=== Register layout

The error bank registers are organized as a 64-byte header providing information
about the error bank followed by an array of 64-byte error records. The offset
of error record numbered `i` in the bank is (64 + `i` * 64) where `i` may range
from 0 to 62.

.Error bank Memory-mapped register layout
[width=100%]
[%header, cols="^9,9,^3, 27"]
|===
|Offset       |Name               |Size|Description

|120 + 64 * i | Custom            |8   |Designated for custom use.
|===

=== Reset behavior

The reset value is `UNSPECIFIED` for RERI registers.

The registers of an error bank may preserve their value across certain types of
reset. For example, a warm reset or a RAS initiated reset may preserve the
register values whereas a cold reset may reset the values back to their initial
state.

[NOTE]
====
Under normal circumstances, when an error is signaled, the RAS handler retrieves
the logged errors to process the error condition. In some cases, the RAS handler
may not be able to do such processing. For example, the system may be unable to
support execution of the RAS handler and cause a RAS initiated reset. Preserving
the information logged in error records across such resets allows reporting of
unhandled errors that occured in a previous boot of the system.
====

All registers in an error bank must have the same reset behavior.

=== Error bank registers

==== Vendor and implementation ID (`vendor_n_imp_id`)

The `vendor_n_imp_id` register is a read-only register and its layout is:

.Vendor and implementation ID
[wavedrom, , ]
....
{reg: [
  {bits: 32, name: 'vendor_id'},
  {bits: 16, name: 'imp_id'},
  {bits: 16, name: 'reserved'},
], config:{lanes: 2, hspace:1024}}
....

The `vendor_id` field follows the encoding as defined by `mvendorid` CSR and
provides the JEDEC manufacturer ID of the provider of the component hosting the
error bank. A value of 0 may be returned to indicate the field is not
implemented or that this is a non-commercial implementation.

The `imp_id` provides a unique identity, defined by the vendor, to identify the
component and revisions of the component implementation hosting the error bank.
A value of 0 may be returned to indicate that the field is not implemented. The
value returned should reflect the design of the component itself and not of the
surrounding system.

[NOTE]
====
The `vendor_id` and the `imp_id` are expected to be used as a identifier to
determine the format of fields and encodings that `UNSPECIFIED` by this
specification.
====

==== Error bank information (`bank_info`)

The `bank_info` is a read-only register and its layout is as follows:

.Error bank information
[wavedrom, , ]
....
{reg: [
  {bits: 16, name: 'inst_id'},
  {bits: 16, name: 'n_err_recs'},
  {bits: 24, name: 'reserved'},
  {bits:  8, name: 'version'},
], config:{lanes: 2, hspace:1024}}
....

The `version` field returns the version of the architectural register layout
specification implemented by the error bank. The version defined by this
specification is 0x01.

[NOTE]
====
The offset of the `version` field in the error bank shall not change across
versions of the register layout. Software should first read the `version` field
and use the value to determine the register layout.
====

The `inst_id` field identifies a unique instance, within a package or at least a
silicon die, of the component; ideally unique in the whole system. The `inst_id`
are defined by the vendor of the system as a unique identifier for the component.
A value of 0 may be returned to indicate the field is not implemented.

[NOTE]
====
The `inst_id` are expected to be collected and logged as part of the RAS error
logs. These may allow the vendor of the silicon to make inferences about the
instances of the components that may be vulnerable. As these values differ
between vendors of the system and even among systems provided by the same
vendor, these are not expected to be useful to the majority of software besides
software intimately familiar with that system implementation.
====

The `n_err_recs` field indicates the number of error records implemented by the
error bank. The field is allowed to have a unsigned value between 1 and 63. The
error records of an error bank are located in the 4 KiB memory mapped region
reserved for the error bank such that the first error record is at offset 64
and the last error record at offset (64 + 63 * `n_err_recs`).

==== Summary of valid error records (`valid_summary`)

The `valid_summary` is a read-only register and its layout is as follows:

.Summary of valid error records
[wavedrom, , ]
....
{reg: [
  {bits: 1,  name: 'summary_valid'},
  {bits: 63, name: 'valid_bitmap'},
], config:{lanes: 4, hspace:1024}}
....

The `summary_valid` bit when 1 indicates that the `valid_bitmap` provides a
summary of the `valid` bits from the status registers in the error records of
this error bank. If this bit is 0 then the error bank does not provide a
summary of valid bits and the `valid_bitmap` is 0.

[NOTE]
====
If `summary_valid` is 1, then software may use the `valid_bitmap` to determine
which error records in the bank are valid. If this bit is 0 then software must
read the `status_register_i` of each implemented error record in this bank to
determine if there is a valid error logged in that error record.
====

=== Error record registers

==== Control register (`control_i`)

The `control_i` is a read/write WARL register used to control error logging by
the corresponding error record in the error bank. The layout of this register
is as follows:

.Control register
[wavedrom, , ]
....
{reg: [
  {bits: 1,  name: 'else'},
  {bits: 1,  name: 'cece'},
  {bits: 1,  name: 'sinv'},
  {bits: 13, name: 'reserved'},
  {bits: 2,  name: 'cee'},
  {bits: 2,  name: 'dee'},
  {bits: 2,  name: 'uee'},
  {bits: 2,  name: 'c3e'},
  {bits: 2,  name: 'c4e'},
  {bits: 2,  name: 'c5e'},
  {bits: 2,  name: 'c6e'},
  {bits: 2,  name: 'c7e'},
  {bits: 16, name: 'eid'},
  {bits:  8, name: 'reserved'},
  {bits:  8, name: 'custom'},
], config:{lanes: 4, hspace:1024}}
....

Error logging and signaling functionality in the error record is enabled if the
`else` field is set to 1. The `else` field is WARL and may default to 1 or 0 at
reset. When `else` is 1, the hardware unit logs and signals errors in the error
record. When `else` is 0, whether the hardware unit continues detecting and
correcting errors is `UNSPECIFIED`.

[NOTE]
====
When error logging and signaling is disabled, the hardware unit may continue to
silently correct detected errors and when correction is not possible provide
corrupt data to the consumers of the data. Alternatively an implementation may
disable error detection altogether when logging and signaling are disabled. It
is recommended that implementations continue performing error correction even
when logging and signaling are disabled.

It is recommended that a hardware component continue to produce error detection
and correction codes on data generated by or stored in the hardware component even
when logging and signaling is disabled. It is recommended hardware components
continue to use containment techniques like data poisoning even when logging and
signaling is disabled.
====

The `cee`, `dee`, and `uee` are WARL fields used to enable signaling of UE, DE,
and CE respectively when they are logged (i.e. when `else` is 1). Enables for
unsupported classes of errors may be hardwired to 0. The encodings of these
fields are specified in <<ERR_SIG_ENABLES>>.

[[ERR_SIG_ENABLES]]
.Error signaling enable filed encodings
[cols="^1,3", options="header"]
|===
| *Encoding* | *Error signal*
| 0          | Signaling is disabled.
| 1          | Signal using a Low-priority RAS signal.
| 2          | Signal using a High-priority RAS signal.
| 3          | Signal using a platform specific RAS signal.
|===

The RAS signals are usually used to notify a RAS error handler. The physical
manifestation of the signal is `UNSPECIFIED` by this specification. The
information carried by the signal is `UNSPECIFIED` by this specification.

[NOTE]
====
The error signaling enables default to 0 - disabled - at reset to allow a RAS
handler an opportunity to initialize itself for handling RAS signals and to
initialize the hardware units that generate the RAS signals before error logging
and signaling is enabled.

The signal generated by the error record may in addition to causing a
interrupt/event notification be also used to carry additional information to aid
the RAS error handler in the platform.

The RAS error handler may be implemented by a RISC-V application processor hart
in the system, a dedicated RAS handling microcontroller, a finite state machine,
etc.

The error signals may be configured, through platform specific means, to notify
a RAS error handler in the platform. For example, the High-priority RAS signal
may be configured to cause a High-priority RAS local interrupt, an external
interrupt, or an NMI and the Low-priority RAS signal may be configured to cause
a Low-priority RAS local interrupt or an external interrupt.
====

If the error record supports CE counting then the corrected-error-counting-enable
(`cece`) field, when set to 1, enables counting CE in the corrected-error-counter
(CEC). The CEC is a counter that holds an unsigned integer count. When `cece` is 0,
the CEC does not count and retains its value. If corrected error counting is not
supported by a hardware unit then `cece` may be hardwired to 0. CEC overflow is
signaled using the signal configured in the `cee` field. When `cece` is 1, the
logging of a CE in does not cause an error signal and an error signal configured
in `cee` occurs only on a CEC overflow.

The `sinv` bit, when written with a value of 1, causes the `v` (valid) field and
the `ceco` field in `status_i` register to be cleared. The `sinv` field always
returns 0 on read.

The error injection delay (`eid`) field is used to control error record
injection. When `eid` is written with a value greater than 1, the `eid` starts
counting down, at an implementation defined rate, till the value reaches a count
of 0. Writing a value of 0 disables the counter. If error injection is not
supported by the error record then the `eid` field may be hardwired to 0. When
`eid` reaches a count of 0, the status register is made valid by setting the
`status_i.v` bit to 1. The `status_i.v` transition from 0 to 1 generates a RAS
signal corresponding to the type of error setup in the `status_i` register. The
counter continues to count even if the `status_i` register was overwritten by a
hardware detected error before the `eid` counts down to 0. 

[NOTE]
====
The error record injection capability only injects an error record and not an
error into the hardware itself. The error record injection capability is
expected to be used to test the RAS handlers and is not intended to be used for
verification of the hardware implementation itself.

Other implementation specific mechanisms may be provided to generate and/or
emulate hardware error conditions. When hardware error injection capabilities
are implemented, the implementation should ensure that these capabilities cannot
be misused to maliciously inject hardware errors that may lead to security
issues.
====

==== Status register (`status_i`)

The `status_i` is a read-write WARL register that reports errors detected by
the hardware unit.

.Status register
[wavedrom, , ]
....
{reg: [
  {bits: 1,  name: 'v'},
  {bits: 1,  name: 'mo'},
  {bits: 1,  name: 'ce'},
  {bits: 1,  name: 'de'},
  {bits: 1,  name: 'ue'},
  {bits: 3,  name: 'pri'},
  {bits: 1,  name: 'c'},
  {bits: 3,  name: 'tt'},
  {bits: 4,  name: 'at'},
  {bits: 1,  name: 'iv'},
  {bits: 1,  name: 'siv'},
  {bits: 1,  name: 'tsv'},
  {bits: 1,  name: 'scrub'},
  {bits: 1,  name: 'ceco'},
  {bits: 3,  name: 'WPRI'},
  {bits: 8,  name: 'ec'},
  {bits: 16, name: 'reserved'},
  {bits: 16, name: 'cec'},
], config:{lanes: 4, hspace:1024}}
....

The error record hold a valid error log if the `v` field is 1.

If the detected error was deferred then `de` is set to 1. If the detected error
was corrected then `ce` is set to 1. If the detected error could not be corrected
or deferred and thus needs urgent handling by an error handler, then the `ue` bit
is set to 1. If the error record does not log a class of errors (e.g., does not
support DE), then the corresponding bit may be hardwired to 0. If the bits
corresponding to more than one error class are set to 1 then the error record
holds information about the highest severity error class among the bits set.

When `v` is 1, if more errors of the same class as the error currently logged in
the error record occur then the `mo` bit is set to indicate the multiple
occurrence of errors of the same severity.

Each error of an error class that may be logged in an error record are
associated with a priority which is a number between 0 and 7; zero being the
highest priority and 7 being the lowest priority. The `pri` field indicates the
priority of the currently logged error in the error record.

When an UE occurs the `c` may be set to 1 to indicate that the error has not
propagated beyond the boundaries of the hardware unit that detected the error
and thus may be *containable* through recovery actions (e.g., terminating the
computation, etc.) carried out by the error recovery handler. The `c` bit is
valid if an UE is recorded in the error record. 

[NOTE]
====
For example, a RISC-V hart by causing the precise data corruption exception on
attempts to consume corrupted/poisoned data may contain the error to the program
currently executing on the hart. A RISC-V RERI by aborting the transaction that
caused the corrupted data from being consumed may contain the error to the device
initiating the transaction, etc.

While the `c` bit indicates that the error may be containable the RAS handler
may or may not be able to recover the system from such errors. The RAS handler
must make the recovery determination based on additional information provided in
the error record such as the address of the memory where corruption was
detected, etc.
====

The address-type (`at`) field indicates the type of address reported in the
`addr_i` register. A error record that does not report addresses may hardwire
this field to 0. The encodings of the `at` field are listed in <<AT_ENCODINGS>>.

[[AT_ENCODINGS]]
.Address type encodings
[cols="^1,3", options="header"]
|===
| *Encoding* | *Description*
| 0          | None. When `at` is 0, the contents of the `addr_i` register are
               `UNSPECIFIED`.
| 1          | Supervisor physical address (SPA).
| 2          | Guest physical address (GPA).
| 3          | Virtual address (VA).
| 4-15       | Component specific.
|===

[NOTE]
====
The component specific address types may be used to report address such as a
local bus address, a DRAM address, etc. The interpretation of such addresses is
component specific.

A set of component specific encodings are defined to allow a platform to use an
encoding per type of component specific addresses.

The `addr_i` register must hold the address of type determined by the `at`
field. Additional non-redundant information about the location accessed using
the address (e.g., cache set and way, etc.) may be reported in the `info_i`
register.
====

The `tt` field reports the type of transaction that detected the error and its
encodings are listed in <<TT_ENCODINGS>>. A error record that does not report
transaction types may hardwire this field to 0.

[[TT_ENCODINGS]]
.Transaction type encodings
[cols="^1,3", options="header"]
|===
| *Encoding* | *Description*
| 0          | Unspecified or not applicable.
| 1-3        | Reserved for future standard extensions.
| 4          | Explicit read.
| 5          | Explicit write.
| 4          | Implicit read.
| 5          | Implicit write.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Implicit read and write are accesses that may be implicitly performed by
hardware to perform an explicit operation. For example, a load or store
instruction executed by the hart may perform implicit memory accesses to page
table data structures. Another example, might be where processing a memory
transaction may require a fabric component to implicitly access a routing table
data structure.

Instruction memory accesses by a hart are termed as implicit accesses by the
hart. However for the purposes of error logging only the implicit accesses to
data structures like the page tables and guest page tables used to determine the
address of the instruction to fetch are termed as implicit accesses. The read to
fetch the instruction bytes themselves are termed as explicit reads.
====

If the detected error reports additional information in the `info_i` register
then `iv` field is set to 1. If the detected error reports additional
supplemental information in the `suppl_info_i` register then `siv` field is set
to 1. The `iv` and/or `siv` fields may be hardwired to 0 if the error record
does not provide information in `info_i` and/or `suppl_info_i` registers.

If the error record holds a timestamp of when the last error was logged in the
`timestamp_i` register then the `tsv` bit is set to 1. This field may be
hardwired to 0 if the error record does not report a timestamp with the error.

The `scrub` bit is valid when a CE is logged and when set to 1 indicates that
the storage location that held the data value has been updated with the
corrected value (i.e., the data has been scrubbed). An implementation that
cannot make this distinction or where the error record is not associated with
storage elements (e.g., correcting errors detected on bus transactions) this
field may be hardwired to 0. If this property is unconditionally true for a
hardware unit then this field may be hardwired to 1.

The `ec` field holds an error code that provides a description of the detected
error. Standard `ec` encodings are defined in <<EC_ENCODINGS>>. If an error
record detects an error that does not correspond to a standard `ec` encoding
then such errors may be reported using a custom encoding. The custom encodings
have the most significant bit set to 1 to differentiated them from the standard
encodings.

An error record that supports the 1 setting of the `cece` field in `control_i`,
implements a 16-bit wide corrected-error-counter in the `cec` field. When
`cece` is 1, the `cec` is incremented on each CE in addition to logging details
of the error in the error record registers. If an integer overflow occurs on
`cec` increment then the corrected-error-counter-overflow (`ceco`) field is set
to 1. The `cec` continues to count following an overflow. The `cec` and `ceco`
fields hold valid data and continue to count even when the `v` field is 0.

[NOTE]
====
Some hardware units may maintain a history of CE and may report a CE and
increment the `cec` only if the error is not identical to a previously reported
CE.

Some hardware units may implement low pass filters (e.g., leaky buckets) that
throttle the rate which CE are reported and counted.
====

When a UE or DE error is logged the `cec` and `ceco` fields are not modified
and retain their values. 

[NOTE]
====
Software may determine if the error record was read atomically by first reading
the registers of the error record, then clearing the valid in `status_i` by
writing 1 to `control_i.sinv` and then reading the `status_i` register again to
determine if the value (besides the `v` field) changed. If a change was detected
then the process may be repeated to read the latest reported error.
====

==== Address register (`addr_i`)

The `addr_i` is a WARL register that reports the address associated with the
detected error when `status_i.at` is not 0. If `status_i.at` is 0, the value in
this register is `UNSPECIFIED`. An implementation that does not report addresses
may hardwire this register to 0. Some fields of the register may be hardwired to
zero if the field is unused to report any type of address. In general, to the
extent possible, the error record should capture all significant parts of the
address. However as a function of the type of error being logged some address
fields may be zeroes. Some highest address bits may be fixed or may be
sign-extensions or may be zero-extensions of the next lowest address bit
depending on the type of address reported.

==== Information register (`info_i`)

The `info_i` field provides additional information about the error when
`status_i.iv` is 1. If `status_i.iv` is 0, the value in this register is
`UNSPECIFIED`. An implementation that does not report any additional
information may hardwire this register to 0.

The format of the register is `UNSPECIFIED` by this specification. This field
may be interpreted using the error code in `status_i.ec` along with
implementation specific and implementation defined format and rules.

[NOTE]
====
This field may be used to report error specific information to help locate the
failing component, guide recovery actions, whether error is transient or
permanent, etc. The field may be used to report more detailed information about
the location of the error within the component. For example, set and way where
the error was detected, the parity group that was in error, the ECC syndrome,
a protocol FSM state, the input that caused an assertion to fail, etc. 

Components that are field replaceable units or detect errors in connected field
replacement units may log additional information in the `info_i` register to
help identify the failing component. For example, a memory controller may log
the memory channel associated with the error such as the DIMM channel, bank,
column, row, rank, subRank, device ID, etc. 
====

==== Supplemental information register (`suppl_info_i`)

The `suppl_info_i` field provides additional information about the error when
`status_i.siv` is 1. This information may supplement the information provided
in `info_i` register. If `status_i.siv` is 0, the value in this register is
`UNSPECIFIED`. An implementation that does not report any supplemental
information may hardwire this register to 0.

The format of the register is `UNSPECIFIED` by this specification. This field
may be interpreted using the error code in `status_i.ec` along with
implementation specific and implementation defined format and rules.

==== Timestamp register (`timestamp_i`)

The `timestamp_i` field provides a timestamp for the last error recorded in the
error record if `status_i.tsv` is 1. When `status.tsv` is 0, the value in this
register is `UNSPECIFIED`. An implementation that does not report a timestamp
may hardwire this register to 0. Some fields of the register may be hardwired
to zero if the field is unused to report the timestamp.

The frequency and resolution of the timestamp are `UNSPECIFIED`.

=== Error record overwrite rules

When a hardware unit detects an error it may find its error record still valid
due to an earlier detected error that has not been consumed yet by software.

The overwrite rules allow a higher severity error to overwrite a lower severity
error. UE has the highest severity, followed by DE, and then CE. When the two errors
have same severity the priority of the errors is used to determine if the error
record is overwritten. Higher priority errors overwrite the lower priority
errors. When a error record is overwritten by a higher severity error (DE/CE by
UE, DE by UE, or CE by DE), the status bits indicating the severity of the first
error are retained (i.e., are sticky). 

The rules for writing the error record are as follows:

.Error record writing rules
[source, ruby]
----
    Let new_status be the value to be recorded in status_i register for the new error
    overwrite = FALSE
    if status_i.v == 1
        // There is a valid first error recorded
        if ( severity(new_error) > severity(status_i) )
            // Severity of second error is higher than first error
            // The DE and CE bits are sticky and retained to provide the
            // overwrite history
            status_i.UE |= new_status.UE
            status_i.DE |= new_status.DE
            status_i.CE |= new_status.CE
            status_i.MO = 0
            overwrite = TRUE
        endif
        if ( severity(new_status) == severity(status_i) )
            // Severity of second error is same as of first error
            // Note multiple occurrences of same severity error
            status_i.MO = 1
            // Overwrite if priority of second error is higher
            if ( new_status.pri > status_i.pri )
                overwrite = TRUE;
            endif
        endif
    else

----
    
When the `status_i.MO` is 1, if the logged error is a UE then the recovery
handler should restart the system to bring it to a correct state as an UE record
has been lost. If the `status_i.MO` is 1 and the logged error is a DE or a CE
then the recovery handler may keep the system operational.

A 0 to 1 transition of the `status_i.v` causes the signal configured in the
`control_i` register for the highest severity error recorded in the error record
to be generated.

=== Error logging defined by other standards

Standards such as PCIe and CXL define standardized error logging architectures
such as the PCIe Advanced Error Reporting (AER). Specifications such as CXL
define a standardized set of RAS requirements to be complied to by host and
devices. The RISC-V RERI extension complements the error reporting architecture
defined by these standards with a RISC-V standard for reporting errors for
components that are not PCIe/CXL components. There may also be other error
logging mechanisms, possibly custom, that are employed alongside the RERI
specification.

The RISC-V system components such as PCIe root ports or PCIe Root Complex Event
Collectors may themselves implement error logging compliant with the RISC-V
RERI extensions and thus provide a unified error reporting mechanism in such
systems. For example, a root complex event collector may support an error log
to report errors logged in the AER logs.
